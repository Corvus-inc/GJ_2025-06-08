    _rawText: "Withering\u2019s easier than I thought."
  - _key: Day3_Flower_Win
    _rawText: "People say \u201CStay strong\u201D. So you hang in there too, huh."
  - _key: Day3_Flower_Defeat
    _rawText: "\u201CStay strong\u201D? What the hell am I supposed to stay strong
      for?"
  - _key: Day4_Flower_Win
    _rawText: "We\u2019re alike."
  - _key: Day4_Flower_Defeat
    _rawText: "We\u2019re alike."

    _rawText: ...
  - _key: Day2_Computer_Win
    _rawText: Is this supposed to be a joke?
  - _key: Day2_Computer_Defeat
    _rawText: "I can\u2019t get it out of my head..."
  - _key: Day3_Computer_Win
    _rawText: Well, I did everything I could.

    _rawText: ...
  - _key: Day4_Computer_Defeat
    _rawText: "\u201CStay strong\u201D? What does that even mean?!"
  - _key: Day5_Computer_Win
    _rawText: Every message feels the same.
  - _key: Day5_Computer_Defeat
    _rawText: The letters are blurring.
  - _key: Day6_Computer0
    _rawText: "What does it say? I can\u2019t tell."
  - _key: Day6_Computer1
    _rawText: It all feels like mockery.
  - _key: Day6_Computer2
    _rawText: "I can\u2019t read this."
  - _key: Day1_Guitar0
    _rawText: "I remember us singing in the kitchen, the four of us\u2026"
  - _key: Day1_Guitar1
    _rawText: We even talked about playing on a stage someday...
  - _key: Day1_Guitar2
    _rawText: "Haven\u2019t played in a while. Should probably tune it sometime."
  - _key: Day2_Guitar0
    _rawText: 'We used to drag it to the lake: campfire, wet sand, strings smelling
      of smoke.'
  - _key: Day2_Guitar1
    _rawText: "Now it\u2019s just deadlines and doctor\u2019s visits. The fires live
      in photos."
  - _key: Day2_Guitar2
    _rawText: "Someday I\u2019ll hold you again."
  - _key: Day3_Guitar0
    _rawText: "I can\u2019t even remember where A minor goes."
  - _key: Day3_Guitar1
    _rawText: "My fingers shake, and my head\u2019s full of test results."
  - _key: Day3_Guitar2
    _rawText: "The guitar\u2019s in the corner. I\u2019m not touching it. Not now."
  - _key: Day4_Guitar0
    _rawText: String snapped. Symbolic.
  - _key: Day4_Guitar1
    _rawText: "Don\u2019t even want to replace it. Let it stay off."
  - _key: Day4_Guitar2
    _rawText: "The strings ring too loud. It\u2019s irritating."
  - _key: Day5_Guitar0
    _rawText: "I want it to sound again. But I can\u2019t."
  - _key: Day5_Guitar1
    _rawText: "It\u2019s dusty. Feels like it\u2019s not mine anymore."
  - _key: Day5_Guitar2
    _rawText: "The guitar doesn\u2019t recognize me. And I don\u2019t recognize it."
  - _key: Day6_Guitar0
    _rawText: Noise in my head drowns everything.
  - _key: Day6_Guitar1
    _rawText: Too heavy. Even my eyes slide past it.
  - _key: Day6_Guitar2
    _rawText: "I don\u2019t have the strength."
  - _key: Day1_Painting0
    _rawText: "I suddenly decided I was going to paint\u2026"
  - _key: Day1_Painting1
    _rawText: I bought brushes, canvases, and even brought an easel from the village...
  - _key: Day1_Painting2
    _rawText: And never finished a single one.
  - _key: Day2_Painting0
    _rawText: "Every time I\u2019d say, \u201CI\u2019ll start painting as soon as
      I wrap up this project\u201D\u2026"
  - _key: Day2_Painting1
    _rawText: "Then another deadline. And another\u2026"
  - _key: Day2_Painting2
    _rawText: The canvases just sit there. Waiting, same as me.
  - _key: Day3_Painting0
    _rawText: "One day I picked up a brush and just stared at the canvas\u2026"
  - _key: Day3_Painting1
    _rawText: "No image, no spark. Only a low hum in my head\u2026"
  - _key: Day3_Painting2
    _rawText: "Set the brush down. Didn\u2019t even pour out the water."
  - _key: Day4_Painting0
    _rawText: "These canvases weigh on me like open loops\u2026"
  - _key: Day4_Painting1
    _rawText: "Everything unfinished starts screaming louder\u2026"
  - _key: Day4_Painting2
    _rawText: What was I even trying to say with them?
  - _key: Day5_Painting0
    _rawText: "Shoved the whole stack into a corner. Kept bumping into it, got angry\u2026"
  - _key: Day5_Painting1
    _rawText: "Wanted to throw it all out, but my hand wouldn\u2019t move\u2026"
  - _key: Day5_Painting2
    _rawText: They just get in the way. Like so much else.
  - _key: Day6_Painting0
    _rawText: "Too much emptiness. Inside me, on the canvas\u2026"
  - _key: Day6_Painting1
    _rawText: "Too late to finish anything now\u2026"
  - _key: Day6_Painting2
    _rawText: "No one\u2019s going to see it anyway."
  - _key: Day1_Books0
    _rawText: "I was always dragging books home from sales \u2014 for \u201Cinspiration\u201D\u2026"
  - _key: Day1_Books1
    _rawText: "Sometimes I\u2019d read at night, mark passages, scribble in the margins\u2026"
  - _key: Day1_Books2
    _rawText: I should at least finish one someday.
  - _key: Day2_Books0
    _rawText: "The bookmark\u2019s still on the same page..."
  - _key: Day2_Books1
    _rawText: What was it even about? I forgot.
  - _key: Day2_Books2
    _rawText: The books stare at me. Judging.
  - _key: Day3_Books0
    _rawText: My brain refuses to absorb the text.
  - _key: Day3_Books1
    _rawText: "I can\u2019t hold a single thought."
  - _key: Day3_Books2
    _rawText: Just meaningless words, wrapped in paper.
  - _key: Day4_Books0
    _rawText: "What could they tell me that I\u2019m not already feeling?"
  - _key: Day4_Books1
    _rawText: No author wrote about this.
  - _key: Day4_Books2
    _rawText: Maybe I should throw them out. Make space.
  - _key: Day5_Books0
    _rawText: The shelf feels heavier somehow...
  - _key: Day5_Books1
    _rawText: "It all presses down like someone else\u2019s expectations..."
  - _key: Day5_Books2
    _rawText: "I don\u2019t think I can even read the titles anymore."
  - _key: Day6_Books0
    _rawText: "Finishing them won\u2019t make me stronger."
  - _key: Day6_Books1
    _rawText: The books are gone. Just empty rectangles now.
  - _key: Day6_Books2
    _rawText: "I can\u2019t."
  - _key: Day1_Basket0
    _rawText: I wanted to learn knitting, but I never had the patience.
  - _key: Day1_Basket1
    _rawText: "Someday I\u2019ll make a scarf. Maybe for me. Maybe for someone else."
  - _key: Day1_Basket2
    _rawText: The colors feel so warm. Nice to touch.
  - _key: Day2_Basket0
    _rawText: "There\u2019s always something else. No time for yarn."
  - _key: Day2_Basket1
    _rawText: I started a couple times. Then gave up.
  - _key: Day2_Basket2
    _rawText: They tangle just like my thoughts.
  - _key: Day3_Basket0
    _rawText: "The hook\u2019s broken. I didn\u2019t even notice when."
  - _key: Day3_Basket1
    _rawText: Everything feels so thin. Fragile.
  - _key: Day3_Basket2
    _rawText: "I can\u2019t focus. Every stitch feels like a task."
  - _key: Day4_Basket0
    _rawText: "I\u2019m not even angry. Just watching it fade away..."
  - _key: Day4_Basket1
    _rawText: Like everything else.
  - _key: Day4_Basket2
    _rawText: A monument to old ambitions.
  - _key: Day5_Basket0
    _rawText: Even the yarn looks tired.
  - _key: Day5_Basket1
    _rawText: I should throw it out.
  - _key: Day5_Basket2
    _rawText: Why is it so hard to let go of useless things?
  - _key: Day6_Basket0
    _rawText: Fine motor skills are the enemy now.
  - _key: Day6_Basket1
    _rawText: "My hands won\u2019t listen."
  - _key: Day6_Basket2
    _rawText: "Everything in this basket is a frozen \u201Cwhat never was.\u201D"
  - _key: Day1_Window0
    _rawText: I love the morning light. Everything feels possible.
  - _key: Day1_Window1
    _rawText: "Even the birds sound like they\u2019re whispering."
  - _key: Day1_Window2
    _rawText: "It\u2019s a good day."
  - _key: Day2_Window0
    _rawText: "It\u2019s sunny\u2026 but strange. Like it\u2019s on delay."
  - _key: Day2_Window1
    _rawText: Today was supposed to be a good day. Maybe.
  - _key: Day2_Window2
    _rawText: Fog?
  - _key: Day3_Window0
    _rawText: "Everyone else\u2019s life keeps going\u2026"
  - _key: Day3_Window1
    _rawText: "People move forward. I feel like I\u2019m not allowed."
  - _key: Day3_Window2
    _rawText: The world outside looks out of focus.
  - _key: Day4_Window0
    _rawText: Rain noise makes it hard to think.
  - _key: Day4_Window1
    _rawText: "Puddles reflect the ceiling. Can\u2019t even see the sky."
  - _key: Day4_Window2
    _rawText: "Everything\u2019s gone gray. Even the trees."
  - _key: Day5_Window0
    _rawText: Thunder, somewhere far off.
  - _key: Day5_Window1
    _rawText: "Just water and glass. That\u2019s all."
  - _key: Day5_Window2
    _rawText: "There\u2019s barely any light."
  - _key: Day6_Window0
    _rawText: Storm. Lightning like torn-up thoughts.
  - _key: Day6_Window1
    _rawText: "The world\u2019s losing it. And I\u2019m just\u2026 left behind."
  - _key: Day6_Window2
    _rawText: "I can\u2019t see anything. Not even myself in the reflection."
