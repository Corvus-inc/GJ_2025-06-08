Day5_Bed0,I don’t want to sleep yet.
Day5_Bed1,I have to do something.
Day6_Bed0,I don’t want to sleep yet.
Day6_Bed1,"It’s hard, but I need to at least try..."
Day1_Awakening,New day. Let’s begin.
Day2_Awakening,I feel… off. Maybe just tired.
Day3_Awakening,Sleep didn’t help. I just need to start moving.
Day4_Awakening,Feels like this body isn’t mine.
Day5_Awakening,Everything feels so heavy…
Day1_Sleep,Wish I could just get some real sleep.
Day2_Sleep,Can’t get it out of my head.
Day3_Sleep,What if tomorrow’s worse?
Day4_Sleep,"Please, just make it all stop."
Day1_Door_Win,Got a bit more energy after the run.
Day1_Door_Defeat,No time to keep going.
Day2_Door_Win,Still in shape.
Day2_Door_Defeat,Today was… rough.
Day3_Door_Win,"It was hard, but I’m not giving up."
Day3_Door_Defeat,It was hard…
Day4_Door_Win,My heart’s pounding.
Day4_Door_Defeat,I can’t do this anymore…
Day5_Door_Win,Can I still keep going?
Day5_Door_Defeat,Feels like I’m not in shape anymore.
Day6_Door0,No. Not today.
Day6_Door1,I can’t do this anymore...
Flower_WateringCup,Need a watering can.
Day1_Flower_Win,"Grow, little flower."
Day1_Flower_Defeat,It’s okay. Maybe next time.
Day2_Flower_Win,You’ve got this.
Day2_Flower_Defeat,Withering’s easier than I thought.
Day3_Flower_Win,"People say “Stay strong”. So you hang in there too, huh."
Day3_Flower_Defeat,“Stay strong”? What the hell am I supposed to stay strong for?
Day4_Flower_Win,We’re alike.
Day4_Flower_Defeat,We’re alike.
Day5_Flower_Win,Feels like we’re both falling apart.
Day5_Flower_Defeat,Feels like we’re both falling apart.
Day6_Flower_Win,I’m sorry.
Day6_Flower_Defeat,I’m sorry.
Day1_Kitchen_Win,Simple food tastes the best.
Day1_Kitchen_Defeat,Should’ve just ordered delivery.
Day2_Kitchen_Win,Tastes good.
Day2_Kitchen_Defeat,Not really hungry.
Day3_Kitchen_Win,...
Day3_Kitchen_Defeat,Taste’s kind of gone.
Day4_Kitchen_Win,Tastes like laundry detergent.
Day4_Kitchen_Defeat,...
Day5_Kitchen_Win,I can’t. I just can’t.
Day5_Kitchen_Defeat,I can’t. I just can’t.
Day6_Kitchen_Win,I don’t feel anything. Not hunger. Not taste.

Day2_Computer_Win,Is this supposed to be a joke?
Day2_Computer_Defeat,I can’t get it out of my head...
Day3_Computer_Win,"Well, I did everything I could."
Day3_Computer_Defeat,I can’t focus.
Day4_Computer_Win,...
Day4_Computer_Defeat,“Stay strong”? What does that even mean?!
Day5_Computer_Win,Every message feels the same.
Day5_Computer_Defeat,The letters are blurring.
Day6_Computer0,What does it say? I can’t tell.
Day6_Computer1,It all feels like mockery.
Day6_Computer2,I can’t read this.
Day1_Guitar0,"I remember us singing in the kitchen, the four of us…"
Day1_Guitar1,We even talked about playing on a stage someday...
Day1_Guitar2,Haven’t played in a while. Should probably tune it sometime.
Day2_Guitar0,"We used to drag it to the lake: campfire, wet sand, strings smelling of smoke."
Day2_Guitar1,Now it’s just deadlines and doctor’s visits. The fires live in photos.
Day2_Guitar2,Someday I’ll hold you again.
Day3_Guitar0,I can’t even remember where A minor goes.
Day3_Guitar1,"My fingers shake, and my head’s full of test results."
Day3_Guitar2,The guitar’s in the corner. I’m not touching it. Not now.
Day4_Guitar0,String snapped. Symbolic.
Day4_Guitar1,Don’t even want to replace it. Let it stay off.
Day4_Guitar2,The strings ring too loud. It’s irritating.
Day5_Guitar0,I want it to sound again. But I can’t.
Day5_Guitar1,It’s dusty. Feels like it’s not mine anymore.
Day5_Guitar2,The guitar doesn’t recognize me. And I don’t recognize it.
Day6_Guitar0,Noise in my head drowns everything.
Day6_Guitar1,Too heavy. Even my eyes slide past it.
Day6_Guitar2,I don’t have the strength.
Day1_Painting0,I suddenly decided I was going to paint…
Day1_Painting1,"I bought brushes, canvases, and even brought an easel from the village..."
Day1_Painting2,And never finished a single one.
Day2_Painting0,"Every time I’d say, “I’ll start painting as soon as I wrap up this project”…"
Day2_Painting1,Then another deadline. And another…
Day2_Painting2,"The canvases just sit there. Waiting, same as me."
Day3_Painting0,One day I picked up a brush and just stared at the canvas…
Day3_Painting1,"No image, no spark. Only a low hum in my head…"
Day3_Painting2,Set the brush down. Didn’t even pour out the water.
Day4_Painting0,These canvases weigh on me like open loops…
Day4_Painting1,Everything unfinished starts screaming louder…
Day4_Painting2,What was I even trying to say with them?
Day5_Painting0,"Shoved the whole stack into a corner. Kept bumping into it, got angry…"
Day5_Painting1,"Wanted to throw it all out, but my hand wouldn’t move…"
Day5_Painting2,They just get in the way. Like so much else.
Day6_Painting0,"Too much emptiness. Inside me, on the canvas…"
Day6_Painting1,Too late to finish anything now…
Day6_Painting2,No one’s going to see it anyway.
Day1_Books0,I was always dragging books home from sales — for “inspiration”…
Day1_Books1,"Sometimes I’d read at night, mark passages, scribble in the margins…"
Day1_Books2,I should at least finish one someday.
Day2_Books0,The bookmark’s still on the same page...
Day2_Books1,What was it even about? I forgot.
Day2_Books2,The books stare at me. Judging.
Day3_Books0,My brain refuses to absorb the text.
Day3_Books1,I can’t hold a single thought.
Day3_Books2,"Just meaningless words, wrapped in paper."
Day4_Books0,What could they tell me that I’m not already feeling?
Day4_Books1,No author wrote about this.
Day4_Books2,Maybe I should throw them out. Make space.
Day5_Books0,The shelf feels heavier somehow...
Day5_Books1,It all presses down like someone else’s expectations...
Day5_Books2,I don’t think I can even read the titles anymore.
Day6_Books0,Finishing them won’t make me stronger.
Day6_Books1,The books are gone. Just empty rectangles now.
Day6_Books2,I can’t.
Day1_Basket0,"I wanted to learn knitting, but I never had the patience."
Day1_Basket1,Someday I’ll make a scarf. Maybe for me. Maybe for someone else.
Day1_Basket2,The colors feel so warm. Nice to touch.
Day2_Basket0,There’s always something else. No time for yarn.
Day2_Basket1,I started a couple times. Then gave up.
Day2_Basket2,They tangle just like my thoughts.
Day3_Basket0,The hook’s broken. I didn’t even notice when.
Day3_Basket1,Everything feels so thin. Fragile.
Day3_Basket2,I can’t focus. Every stitch feels like a task.
Day4_Basket0,I’m not even angry. Just watching it fade away...
Day4_Basket1,Like everything else.
Day4_Basket2,A monument to old ambitions.
Day5_Basket0,Even the yarn looks tired.
Day5_Basket1,I should throw it out.
Day5_Basket2,Why is it so hard to let go of useless things?
Day6_Basket0,Fine motor skills are the enemy now.
Day6_Basket1,My hands won’t listen.
Day6_Basket2,Everything in this basket is a frozen “what never was.”
Day1_Window0,I love the morning light. Everything feels possible.
Day1_Window1,Even the birds sound like they’re whispering.
Day1_Window2,It’s a good day.
Day2_Window0,It’s sunny… but strange. Like it’s on delay.
Day2_Window1,Today was supposed to be a good day. Maybe.
Day2_Window2,Fog?
Day3_Window0,Everyone else’s life keeps going…
Day3_Window1,People move forward. I feel like I’m not allowed.
Day3_Window2,The world outside looks out of focus.
Day4_Window0,Rain noise makes it hard to think.
Day4_Window1,Puddles reflect the ceiling. Can’t even see the sky.
Day4_Window2,Everything’s gone gray. Even the trees.
Day5_Window0,"Thunder, somewhere far off."
Day5_Window1,Just water and glass. That’s all.
Day5_Window2,There’s barely any light.
Day6_Window0,Storm. Lightning like torn-up thoughts.
Day6_Window1,The world’s losing it. And I’m just… left behind.
Day6_Window2,I can’t see anything. Not even myself in the reflection.
